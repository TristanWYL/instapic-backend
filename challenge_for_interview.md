- [ ] Validation and error handling
- [ ] Automated tests

### Optional
- [ ] Can sort all posts by time created, or filter posts by a specific user.
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Pagination

## Deliverable
Please share your repo with us and publish on a platform of your choice (Heroku, AWS, etc). Have a README that documents how to run your source.
- [ ] Production URL (Heroku, Netlify, etc.)
- [ ] Source code (Github, Bitbucket, etc.)
- [ ] Documentation on how to run the source code
- [ ] Documentation on your API

## Grading and Submission Requirements
- Graded based on code quality and test coverage

## 2. Frontend Challenge
路 Make a simple app that uses the backend API from the backend challenge to provide a frontend for InstaPic. You can use any frontend framework of your choice (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)
路 Feel free to implement the UI your own way. However we'll pay attention to code quality, and how neatly you implement it.
